Getting up at 6 for work during the week means my lie-ins are less than wonderful.<br><br>8:00 - Spent morning cleaning and tidying rented house before moving out.<br><br>10:00 - Went to check-in to the uni room I’m renting for a week. My booking wasn’t on the system. Took two hours to get me a key.<br><br>12:00 - Taken to see uni room. Put in the furthest block from my rented house that the college owns.<br><br>12:15-2:45 - Made five trips between rented house and uni room, with two suitcases and a backpack each time. Feel pains in muscles I didn’t know I had.<br><br>3:00 - Started waiting for taxi I had ordered for the heavy/awkward stuff.<br><br>3:15 - Called taxi place to ask where my transport was. Told “he’ll be there in 30 seconds”.<br><br>3:30 - Taxi arrives. After being 30mins late, still charged £5 to take me all of 500ft.<br><br>3:45 - Landlord arrives for 4pm meeting. Appears irritated that I’m still doing dishes, despite arriving 15 minutes early.  <br><br>4:00 - Landlord tries to screw me over; charging me for a broken chair (which I had brought to the house) and a wobbly lamp (which was wobbly when we moved in). Got the full hands-on-hips, “appeal would take ages and cost loads and you’ll never win so just pay for whatever we say” treatment.<br><br>5:00 - Discovered internet doesn’t work in my uni room. Fridge/freezer contains some minced beef and a can of Guinness.<br><br>6:00 - Pretty ready to go home. Weird that.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 7, 2022</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcavan.us%2Flast-day-in-durham%2F&amp;via=PJCavan&amp;text=Last%20Day%20in%20Durham" class="js-share icon brands fa-twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://cavan.us/authors/peter-cavan/" class="invert" rel="author">Peter J.
