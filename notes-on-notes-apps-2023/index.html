A few comments in a thread.</p><ol><li>Nothing, paid or free, ticked every box I wanted. Could not 'pay my way out' to the ideal option.</li><li>The import/export landscape for notes beyond text (rich text, attachments, etc) seems to have regressed. In ye olden days when <a href="https://evernote.com">Evernote</a> was a dominant player (and, to be fair, made a decent format in ENEX) the pathway was straightforward - get your notes to ENEX (perhaps with a temporary Evernote account), then your new service would likely import it. Various services have scaled back their import options, including Evernote (you can get around with an old .exe).</li><li><a href="https://www.notion.so">Notion</a> was perhaps the hardest to evaluate. It has a good web version, Windows and Mac apps (no Linux), few (relevant) caps on the free accounts, powerful templates, etc. You could run all sorts of businesses largely on Notion. But, it felt too heavy/busy for my needs.</li><li>If you're willing to stick to plain text or Markdown there are all sorts of options, from <a href="https://keep.google.com">Google Keep</a> to <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>/<a href="https://joplinapp.org">Joplin</a>/<a href="https://bear.app">Bear</a>/<a href="https://standardnotes.com">Standard</a>/etc. That didn't fit my needs.</li><li>The final four were OneNote, Evernote, Notion, Apple Notes. Notion addressed above. Apple Notes, being Apple + data, had quirks, such as importing everything with a December 2010 date. Evernote was a strong contender but feels in flux (in process of being acquired). OneNote is currently one of the ugliest options (refresh expected in Q2) and isn't great with export, but ticks the rest of my boxes for $0.</li></ol></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 22, 2024</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://cavan.us/authors/peter-cavan/" class="invert" rel="author">Peter Cavan</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://cavan.us/tags/energy/" target="_self">Energy</a></li><li><a href="https://cavan.us/tags/essay/" target="_self">Essays</a></li></ul></nav><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">Â© Peter Cavan - All rights reserved<br>Powered by Publii</p></footer></div></div></div><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/main.min.js?v=08add7f6d435054ad38ec38d7cf8be40"></script><script>var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};</script></body></html>
