Primarily taken from "<em>Natural Skagit - a journey from mountains to sea</em>" by Tim Robbins and "<em>The North Cascades Highway</em>" by Jack McLeod. </p><p>Natural world, flora &amp; fauna</p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li1">100 million years ago the coastline was along Idaho. Volcanic islands kept colliding with West coast, adding land. Mountain ranges rose up and gave us what is now Washington state.</li><li>The Juan de Fuca plate is being consumed under the North American plate. Magnitude 9 earthquake in 1700, will be repeated every 300-500 years. Moves 1-2” per year and will eventually be consumed back into the Earth.</li><li>Climate: coastal temperature rainforest. Less than 0.2% of land. Otherwise mostly Patagonia and New Zealand.</li><li class="li1">The Skagit River is 160 miles long and drains ten billion gallons of fresh water per day into Salish sea.</li><li class="li1">Skagit Gorge is almost 6000ft high. 1896 road commission said a route over it was not practical.</li><li>Salmon never ran in the Upper Skagit because of the Skagit Gorge.</li><li>Salmon provide food to 137 other species, including their own young and 58 bird species.</li><li>North Cascades feature the pika, a mouse-like animal with high internal temperature and thick fur. Has to live under 50F.</li><li>Tulips: Mary Brown Stewart imported bulbs in 1906</li></ul><p>Infrastructure</p><ul class="ul1"><li><p class="p1">Dikes added from 1863 to give more arable land amongst the salty marshes.</p></li><li class="li1">Diablo Dam: 389 feet in 1930. Was tallest dam in the world.</li><li>Why is Diablo Lake teal? Rock flour - colloidal (suspended) particles of rock ground up by glaciers.</li><li>Northern State Park (Northern Hospital for the Insane) was designed by the Olmstead brothers, sons of the designer of Central Park</li><li class="li1">Ross Dam: finished in 1956. Was supposed to be another 125ft high - blocked by local opposition which also pretty much ended local dam construction.</li><li class="li1">In 1890s SR20 was expected to go more South. Rather than going to Ross Lake, head pretty well West from Twisp to Marblemount. Considered too steep and avalanche-prone.</li><li class="li1">SR20 remained open all winter in 1976/77 (drought).</li></ul><p>People</p><ul class="ul1"><li>First permanent (European) Resident: Blanket Bill Jarman (and native Klallam wife) canoed from Port Townsend to Samish Island in 1852.</li><li>Puget Sound had 75,000 residents in 1890 and 1.1 million in 1910, driven largely by Alaska gold rush. </li><li>Concrete came out of a merger between Baker and Cement City in 1909. It now has half the population, given the closure of the cement plant in 1967.</li><li>Jack Kerouac manned the fire towers on Desolation Peak and Sourdough and Crater mountains.</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 9, 2025</p></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://cavan.us/tags/energy/" target="_self">Energy</a></li><li><a href="https://cavan.us/tags/essay/" target="_self">Essays</a></li></ul></nav><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">© Peter Cavan - All rights reserved<br>Powered by Publii</p></footer></div></div></div><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/main.min.js?v=08add7f6d435054ad38ec38d7cf8be40"></script><script>var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};</script></body></html>
