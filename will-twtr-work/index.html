For a site like Twitter to make its current valuation any more than happy time fairy dust, it needs to:</p><p><strong>#1. Make gobs more money (read: ARPU) from existing revenue channels</strong>, primarily through more sponsored tweets and selling user data more aggressively.</p><p><br>AND/OR</p><p><br><strong>#2. Find bountiful new revenue sources</strong>, whether closely complementary (e.g. more card-based advertising options) or tangential (think Amazon selling cloud storage).</p><p><br>WHILE</p><p><br>#<strong>3. Maintaining and growing the user base</strong>. Twitter is attractive to advertisers today because it has over 200m active users, who happen to be younger, better educated and richer than any other high volume channel.</p><p>Can Twitter do #1 and/or #2 while keeping #3, their users, on board?</p><p>—</p><p>For a case study, consider MySpace. In 2005* the site was purchased by News Corporation for $580m after a fierce bidding war with Viacom. MySpace initially concentrated solely on #3, gaining its 100 millionth user account in 2006 and a $12bn valuation in 2007 as the largest social network on the planet.</p><p>The story does not end well. MySpace had #3 in spades, but its attempt to realize #1, through a $900m advertising deal with Google, was part of the reason** its popularity fell off a cliff. By 2009 Facebook had conclusively won the war, and MySpace was sold for $35m (m, not b) in 2011.</p><p>*Fun fact: earlier that year, Mark Zuckerburg offered Facebook to MySpace’s CEO, Chris DeWolfe, for $75m. DeWolfe said no.<br>**Naturally there were many others, from terrible product management to an association with spam and pornography.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://cavan.us/tags/energy/" target="_self">Energy</a></li><li><a href="https://cavan.us/tags/essay/" target="_self">Essays</a></li></ul></nav><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">© 2024 Peter J.
