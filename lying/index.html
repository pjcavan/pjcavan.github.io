How many turned up (explanation of debate)<br><br>I’d categorize the justifications to Sean Spicer &amp; Donald Trump’s comments into three buckets:<br><br>1. “Lying is bad, but they didn’t lie.”<br><br>There are already a substantial number of 9/11-Truther-style “there were actually over a million people at Trump’s inauguration but the MSM is lying to us!” theories. I won’t further elucidate how they might be mistaken.<br><br>2. “Lying is bad, but a lying Trump is better than a crooked Hillary.”<br><br>This realpolitik notion understands that Spicer &amp; Trump told bald-faced lies in recent days, and accepts that lying is a bad thing, but rationalizes their flaws as acceptable when compared to a greater evil (in their mind, Democrats in power).<br><br>3. “Trump lied, and that’s a good thing.”<br><br>This position is the hardest to parse, but a longer version is ‘we’ve had generations of scheming, elitist politicians who hate Real America . Donald might lie, but that just shows that he’s a real person who’ll always do what’s right for Real Americans.”<br><br>(why does this matter? they’ll lie about other things, and their supporters won’t care.)</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 22, 2024</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://cavan.us/authors/peter-cavan/" class="invert" rel="author">Peter Cavan</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://cavan.us/tags/energy/" target="_self">Energy</a></li><li><a href="https://cavan.us/tags/essay/" target="_self">Essays</a></li></ul></nav><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">© Peter Cavan - All rights reserved<br>Powered by Publii</p></footer></div></div></div><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/main.min.js?v=08add7f6d435054ad38ec38d7cf8be40"></script><script>var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};</script></body></html>
