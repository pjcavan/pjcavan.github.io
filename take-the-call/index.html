Emailed the teacher, who happens to be technophobic. By the time I slipped into class 20 minutes late, my explanation and apology hadn’t been seen. Not an ideal start.</p><p>At 11am, full of redeeming zeal, I raise my hand to ask a tough question, combining motivational psychology with Marxist economics. The teacher pauses, then begins her reply. </p><p><strong>Bleep.</strong> My phone rings. It’s quiet, but audible in an otherwise silent classroom. The technophobic teacher’s unconditional ban on electronic devices in the classroom amplifies the awkward buzz.</p><p>What do I do? In the middle of the lecturer’s answer, as she stares in disbelief, I stand and walk out of the class.</p><p>Some explanation is in order. The call was from an HR manager, at a company I’m passionate about joining. The person had been trying to contact me for most of the previous day, to fill a position they needed ASAP. It was getting close to the “get in touch or forget it” stage, so I prioritized the call over the class.</p><p>Looking back, I should have ignored it and called after class, but after waiting so long the desire to answer it was unyielding. If I land the job and pass the class, it was worth it.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://cavan.us/tags/energy/" target="_self">Energy</a></li><li><a href="https://cavan.us/tags/essay/" target="_self">Essays</a></li></ul></nav><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">© 2024 Peter J.
