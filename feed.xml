                <p>I may do a post on why I moved to <a href="https://bear.app">Bear</a> later; for now, a brief comment on the transition.</p>

<p>If you've been a long term <a href="https://www.onenote.com">OneNote</a> user and want to jump over to Bear, you'll likely want to bring your old notes with you. That is possible, but can be a pain. </p>
<p>A brief search will offer all sorts of options: perhaps export as HTML, or Word docs (?), or copy manually (the horror), or <a href="https://github.com/epatters/onenote-export">online services</a> that pull from the Office API, or the Obsidian importer (then export back out to Bear), or a wide universe of Python scripts that scrape OneNote into a Pandoc conversion. </p>
<p>None of those worked well for me. The closest was <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/import/onenote">Obsidian's first-party OneNote importer</a> - it pulled in the first OneNote workbook I pointed it at, then steadfastly refused any further ones. If you go that route, I recommend having Obsidian pull all of your OneNote content at once, even if that complicates later organization.</p>
<p>What did work: find an old (v6.5) binary of Evernote<sup id="fnref:1"> <a href="#fn:1">1</a> </sup>. You won't find them on Evernote's site anymore but a brief search will bring up links. Install it and use Evernote's dedicated OneNote importer, then export that to Evernote's export format (ENEX). Have Bear import that ENEX and you're mostly done. </p>
<p>It's the least bad method I found by a large margin but there are quirks to be aware of.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bear uses a tag- rather than folder-based structure and will not respect the folder structure automatically. My work-around was to import one workbook at a time and apply folder-imitating tags (use the 'untagged' smart tag after each import). </li>
<li>The rich-text-to-Markdown conversion is... a mixed bag. All text content should be there; conversion of bulleted lists and tables is iffy. </li>
<li>Each note will have the creation date and time added (within the body) at the top, and "Created with OneNote" at the bottom. </li>
</ul>

                <p>Every few years I get the bug to try out Linux - is this the year of the Linux desktop? My very brief notes from the 2023 version are below. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://ghostbsd.org">GhostBSD:</a> buggy.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a> full version: install directory too small.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a> net install: fine, dull.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.debian.org">Debian</a> stable: probably fine, don't like Gnome 3.38. Old packages in general.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.debian.org">Debian</a> testing: fine. With various UIs:
<ul>
<li>Gnome 43: don't love.</li>
<li>Cinammon: ugly version.</li>
<li>KDE: ugly.</li>
<li>XFCE: fine, bit dull.</li>
<li>Mate: dull.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://mxlinux.org">MX Linux</a>: no, too lite.</li>
<li><a href="https://manjaro.org">Manjaro</a>: fine.</li>
<li><a href="https://linuxmint.com">Mint</a>: good so far.</li>
</ul>
<p>Addendum (March 2023): Mint was my favorite of the distros tested, by a surprisingly large margin. There is no single reason why - it simply felt like the best combination of reliability, features and polish. I did not stick with it, for Linux rather than Mint reasons - returned to Windows then to Mac. </p>

                <p>The output of my evaluation of notes apps: tested nine options, sticking with OneNote. A few comments in a thread.</p>

<ol>
<li>Nothing, paid or free, ticked every box I wanted. Could not 'pay my way out' to the ideal option.</li>
<li>The import/export landscape for notes beyond text (rich text, attachments, etc) seems to have regressed. In ye olden days when <a href="https://evernote.com">Evernote</a> was a dominant player (and, to be fair, made a decent format in ENEX) the pathway was straightforward - get your notes to ENEX (perhaps with a temporary Evernote account), then your new service would likely import it. Various services have scaled back their import options, including Evernote (you can get around with an old .exe).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.notion.so">Notion</a> was perhaps the hardest to evaluate. It has a good web version, Windows and Mac apps (no Linux), few (relevant) caps on the free accounts, powerful templates, etc. You could run all sorts of businesses largely on Notion. But, it felt too heavy/busy for my needs.</li>
<li>If you're willing to stick to plain text or Markdown there are all sorts of options, from <a href="https://keep.google.com">Google Keep</a> to <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>/<a href="https://joplinapp.org">Joplin</a>/<a href="https://bear.app">Bear</a>/<a href="https://standardnotes.com">Standard</a>/etc. That didn't fit my needs.</li>
<li>The final four were OneNote, Evernote, Notion, Apple Notes. Notion addressed above. Apple Notes, being Apple + data, had quirks, such as importing everything with a December 2010 date. Evernote was a strong contender but feels in flux (in process of being acquired). OneNote is currently one of the ugliest options (refresh expected in Q2) and isn't great with export, but ticks the rest of my boxes for $0.</li>

I won’t further elucidate how they might be mistaken.<br><br>2. “Lying is bad, but a lying Trump is better than a crooked Hillary.”<br><br>This realpolitik notion understands that Spicer &amp; Trump told bald-faced lies in recent days, and accepts that lying is a bad thing, but rationalizes their flaws as acceptable when compared to a greater evil (in their mind, Democrats in power).<br><br>3. “Trump lied, and that’s a good thing.”<br><br>This position is the hardest to parse, but a longer version is ‘we’ve had generations of scheming, elitist politicians who hate Real America . Donald might lie, but that just shows that he’s a real person who’ll always do what’s right for Real Americans.”<br><br>(why does this matter? they’ll lie about other things, and their supporters won’t care.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Suite Seattle Staycation: Enjoy an upgrade to a suite, guaranteed early check-in of 12PM and a late check-out of 4PM, complimentary self parking for one (1) vehicle and a $50 off massage and/or $50 off any facial during your stay at Penelope &amp; The Beauty Bar (reservations required) as compared to the fully flexible rate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We did not take advantage of the beauty bar discounts - they were silly expensive ($400-1300). It's a five star hotel, the spa is expensive, fair enough. </p>
<p>We were less impressed that we were suite-less. Our "<em>Suite Seattle Staycation</em>", to "<em>enjoy an upgrade to a suite</em>", got us into what seemed their smallest and most basic room. On mentioning this to the front desk - "<em>oh, yeah, that's not guaranteed. If we don't have a suite you don't get one</em>." Do you then get a refund for the upgrade? Ha, not a chance. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pinto beans, soaked overnight with salt, then the water drained (gets rid of some of the oligosaccharides that can cause flatulence), then boiled with sliced onions, garlic and bay leaves. Then halfway mashed, so they still have a lot of texture, and seasoned with ancho chile powder, finely ground espresso beans, soy sauce, cider vinegar, salt. The beans actually aren't heavily seasoned; just a small amount of these flavors are added.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/2opd41/carnitas/cmpj4lv/">Rice</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rice is deep fried (I know, we're sensing a trend here). First a soup is prepared with water, vegetable soup base, sliced onions, sliced green peppers, garlic, ancho chile powder, oregano, basil, tomato sauce, cilantro. It should taste just like soup. By volume, about twice as much as the rice. Bring the soup to a boil and let it simmer while the rice fries. To deep fry the rice, it goes in a wire mesh strainer and is lowered into the deep fryer. You keep stirring the rice until it becomes tan colored and acquires a nutty aroma. Then it needs to drain completely for about 5 minutes, then it's very carefully introduced to the soup. After the boiling dies down, it's capped and simmered until done, then fluffed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/2opd41/carnitas/cmqezlo/">Potato Vinegar</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unpeeled Russet potatoes are boiled with salt, garlic and bay, then chilled completely, then diced. They are tossed lightly in this potato vinegar, then deep fried. The acid retards the browning, so they can become very crisp without becoming dark or bitter.<br><br>2/3 cup white vinegar<br>2 tsp salt<br>1 tsp soy sauce<br>1 tsp garlic, crushed<br>1/4 tsp ground cumin<br>1/4 tsp black pepper<br>flour, by eye<br><br>Mix all with a whisk. Whisk in flour until mixture is of a consistency just a little thicker than buttermilk.</p>
