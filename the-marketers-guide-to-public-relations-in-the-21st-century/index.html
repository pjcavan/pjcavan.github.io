For A (high interest for both), just announce a product. B (consumers interested, media not), borrow interest, perhaps by sponsoring a media-friendly event. C (media interested, consumers not), highlight reasons to buy. D (neither interested), hope for the best</p><p>Segment the market, then target the most valuable segments. ‘For a segment’ 'who wants something’ 'our product’ 'provides something’ 'unlike competitor’ 'our product value’</p><p>MPR involves relationships between management, employees and customers.
