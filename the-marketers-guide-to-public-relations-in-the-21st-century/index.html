For A (high interest for both), just announce a product. B (consumers interested, media not), borrow interest, perhaps by sponsoring a media-friendly event. C (media interested, consumers not), highlight reasons to buy. D (neither interested), hope for the best</p><p>Segment the market, then target the most valuable segments. ‘For a segment’ 'who wants something’ 'our product’ 'provides something’ 'unlike competitor’ 'our product value’</p><p>MPR involves relationships between management, employees and customers. External communications are essential, but what about internal communications from management to employees? Relationship marketing from management to customers? Or interactive marketing from field employees to customers?</p><p>Targets: awards, anniversaries, books, competitions, swag, endorsements, fan clubs, press releases, product placements, public service projects, research, stunts, surveys</p><p>News: timelineness, prominence, proximity, significance, unusualness, human, conflict, newness</p><p>Convention Attraction Efficiency: Booth visitors divided by the estimated target audience at the convention</p><p>Convention Conversion Efficiency: Quality leads divided by booth visitors</p><p>Experiential Marketing: Giving potential customers a 'taste’</p><p>B2B Marketing: Characterised by small budgets, many trade publications, relationships with customers rather than users, and small staffs</p><p>Industrial Marketing Budget: 51% sales, 15% exhibition, 12% advertisement, 10% direct marketing, 7% press releases, 5% telecommunications</p><p>Social Responsibility Marketing: The 'triple bottom line’ of marketing</p></blockquote></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 7, 2022</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcavan.us%2Fthe-marketers-guide-to-public-relations-in-the-21st-century%2F&amp;via=PJCavan&amp;text=The%20Marketer's%20Guide%20to%20Public%20Relations%20in%20the%2021st%20Century" class="js-share icon brands fa-twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><strong>Tagged in:</strong></li><li><a href="https://cavan.us/tags/booknotes/">booknotes</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://cavan.us/authors/peter-cavan/" class="invert" rel="author">Peter J.
