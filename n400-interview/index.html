Signed in and waited in large room with another ~60 people for my number to be called. Taken into interview room at 12.30pm.<br><br>Started with English test - had to write "the President lives in the White House" on a tablet. Then civics test - got six out of six. Questions included: how many Senators (100), name a state that borders Canada (Washington), what are the parties (Democrat and Republican), what does the Constitution do (sets up the Government), and who was the president during WW1 (Woodrow Wilson).<br><br>Then ran through my N400 application. Asked to confirm my basic details, my wife's citizenship and birthplace, etc. Had moved house after submitting my application, so showed my house deed as proof. We then went through each of the yes/no questions verbally - I was not a Communist, had not fought in a war, etc.<br><br>The interviewer had me confirm my details on the tablet (that will later go on naturalization certificate), then printed out a form showing my status as recommended for citizenship. He said that I had just missed the cutoff for same-day oath ceremony. Whole interview took 15 minutes.<br><br>I was shuttled back to waiting room for ~30 minutes, then another employee handed me a form saying my ceremony would be two weeks in the future. I was out by 1:15pm.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 20, 2024</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://cavan.us/authors/peter-cavan/" class="invert" rel="author">Peter Cavan</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://cavan.us/tags/energy/" target="_self">Energy</a></li><li><a href="https://cavan.us/tags/essay/" target="_self">Essays</a></li></ul></nav><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">Â© Peter Cavan - All rights reserved<br>Powered by Publii</p></footer></div></div></div><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/main.min.js?v=08add7f6d435054ad38ec38d7cf8be40"></script><script>var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};</script></body></html>
