For reference, Justin Bieber will be 21. I’ll be 26, one short of the great Jimi Hendrix. Where do I see my career? Hopefully I’ll have taken care of my parents, and the other debts I need to repay. I’ll most likely be a mid-level strategy consultant in a major metropolis, for a large multinational corporation.</p><p>What else matters? I’d like a damn good boss, someone I can respect and learn an immense amount from. I’d like a job I believe in, to fulfill the challenge set by my high-school yearbook to leave this a better world than I found it. I’d like a corporate culture that invigorated rather than restrained, aided rather than irritated, innovated rather than maintained. I’d like to leave the company after five, ten or fifteen years; knowing that I helped them to be a better company, they helped me to be a better person, and society benefited from our mutual trade.</p><p>The rest? Which country will I live in? Which benefit scheme? Which company car? Which 401K? Which name written on my pay cheques? That’s not my concern.  </p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 20, 2024</p></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://cavan.us/tags/energy/" target="_self">Energy</a></li><li><a href="https://cavan.us/tags/essay/" target="_self">Essays</a></li></ul></nav><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">© Peter Cavan - All rights reserved<br>Powered by Publii</p></footer></div></div></div><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/main.min.js?v=08add7f6d435054ad38ec38d7cf8be40"></script><script>var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};</script></body></html>
