We upgraded to the "Suite Seattle Staycation" package, described as:</p><blockquote><p>A Suite Seattle Staycation: Enjoy an upgrade to a suite, guaranteed early check-in of 12PM and a late check-out of 4PM, complimentary self parking for one (1) vehicle and a $50 off massage and/or $50 off any facial during your stay at Penelope &amp; The Beauty Bar (reservations required) as compared to the fully flexible rate.</p></blockquote><p>We did not take advantage of the beauty bar discounts - they were silly expensive ($400-1300). It's a five star hotel, the spa is expensive, fair enough. </p><p>We were less impressed that we were suite-less. Our "<em>Suite Seattle Staycation</em>", to "<em>enjoy an upgrade to a suite</em>", got us into what seemed their smallest and most basic room. On mentioning this to the front desk - "<em>oh, yeah, that's not guaranteed. If we don't have a suite you don't get one</em>." Do you then get a refund for the upgrade? Ha, not a chance. </p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 22, 2024</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://cavan.us/authors/peter-cavan/" class="invert" rel="author">Peter Cavan</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://cavan.us/tags/energy/" target="_self">Energy</a></li><li><a href="https://cavan.us/tags/essay/" target="_self">Essays</a></li></ul></nav><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">© Peter Cavan - All rights reserved<br>Powered by Publii</p></footer></div></div></div><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="https://cavan.us/assets/js/main.min.js?v=08add7f6d435054ad38ec38d7cf8be40"></script><script>var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};</script></body></html>
