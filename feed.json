Some people grumble that it’s expensive but buy it anyway. When your grandparent turns up, they’re still getting their cup for the 80c they already paid.</p>\n<p>After the drought ends, your HOA says that selling at $5 was unfair so you must reprice to $2 - you have to give $3 back to everybody you sold at $5 to. If someone knew you sold 100 cups that week, they could say $300 would be returned to customers. Imagine the headlines in the neighbourhood newspaper - “lemonade stand must fix $300 pricing error!” How embarrasing.</p>\n<p>But, $300 won’t be returned. Your grandparent bought at 80c - there’s nothing to return to them. If you had lots of those deals, the total returned might be far, far less than $300.</p>\n",

It transfers C$1.3 billion from energy users to generators every month, and has grown over the past decade to capture over 80% of many customers’ bills. In organized US markets the energy component is usually the majority of the cost but it’s an increasingly minor portion in Ontario (blue bars below). </p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cavan.us/media/posts/11/GA1.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://cavan.us/media/posts/11/responsive/GA1-xs.png 300w ,https://cavan.us/media/posts/11/responsive/GA1-sm.png 480w ,https://cavan.us/media/posts/11/responsive/GA1-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"GA allocation\" width=\"590\" height=\"442\" /></figure></p>\n<p>Larger business customers were previously able to manage how much of the GA pie they’re responsible for through the <a href=\"http://www.ieso.ca/-/media/files/ieso/document-library/global-adjustment/ici-backgrounder.pdf\">Industrial Conservation Initiative (ICI)</a> - by reducing the power they used during the five hours of the year when the system was most stressed, they would pay lower GA costs in future years. This optimization opportunity was worth C$450,000 per MW-year[^2] for businesses who could fully reduce their demand during peak hours, such as shifting to a generator or energy storage. That is a lot - most demand response opportunities in North America are worth $30,000 to $75,000 per MW-year. </p>\n<h5 id=\"instead-the-ga-contribution-will-be-fixed-existing-businesses-will-continue-paying-ga-costs-in-202021-and-202122-based-on-their-peak-contribution-in-201920\">Instead, the GA contribution will be fixed. Existing businesses will continue paying GA costs in 2020/21 and 2021/22 based on their peak contribution in 2019/20.</h5>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://news.ontario.ca/mndmf/en/2020/06/ontario-provides-stable-electricity-pricing-for-industrial-and-commercial-companies\">government’s rationale</a> is that this will encourage businesses to focus on “<em>running at full tilt</em>“ as the province recovers from covid-19, particularly given the oversupply of generating capacity, and provides price stability. Businesses can greatly increase (or decrease) their peak usage over the next two years with no impact on their GA costs (and therefore minimal change to their overall bill). </p>\n<p>The impact will vary for each business. For those who couldn’t manage their peak demand previously, this change allows them to use more energy without worrying about higher GA costs. I have two primary concerns, at the business and system level:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Removing the optimization opportunity will directly hurt some of the Ontario businesses who used demand flexibility services - such as installing energy storage - in the expectation that it would reduce their future GA costs. It won’t, at least for two years. The change will also damage the businesses built in Ontario to deliver those services, from peak predictions to installing generators and batteries. </li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>This could set the province up for difficulties later in the decade. Ontario currently has more generating capacity than it needs, both because of an unusual market design and covid-19-related demand destruction. However, it is still widely expected that the province faces a capacity shortfall - having less electricity supply than needed to safely and reliably meet demand - in the next few years. The graph below is a forecast by Ontario’s system operator, IESO, from January. </li>\n</ol>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cavan.us/media/posts/11/IESOresourceadequacy.PNG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://cavan.us/media/posts/11/responsive/IESOresourceadequacy-xs.PNG 300w ,https://cavan.us/media/posts/11/responsive/IESOresourceadequacy-sm.PNG 480w ,https://cavan.us/media/posts/11/responsive/IESOresourceadequacy-md.PNG 768w\"  alt=\"Capacity shortfall in IESO\" width=\"1404\" height=\"504\" /></figure></p>\n<p>The numbers differ by the predictions used (when key nuclear plants are refurbished, effectiveness of energy efficiency programs, etc) but the direction is the same - on the current path, Ontario is likely to face a capacity shortfall by 2027. </p>\n<p>That short fall can be solved by increasing supply or reducing demand, or (most likely) some combination thereof. The ICI was delivering ~1600MW of demand reduction during the hottest hours of 2018, which businesses will not be incentivized to deliver for the next two summers. </p>\n<p>So, the province may be turning off a major demand flexibility program just before the system would most benefit from that flexibility. Hopefully Ontario’s businesses will be offered new opportunities to help with the grid with their energy management. </p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>I was invited to Basecamp’s <a href=\"https://hey.com/\">Hey</a> email beta on June 16, and finally got around to playing with it this week. It’s a fascinating effort which I applaud, but doesn’t deliver enough value for me to pay the $99/year asking price.<!--more--></p>\n<p>Before diving into Hey, it’s worth explaining my current email workflow. </p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Let’s be honest - most email is cruft. Beyond old-fashioned spam, the vast majority of email is low priority: newsletters, coupons, status updates, etc. Reading it is neither urgent nor important. All such emails I receive are filtered into an “Updates” folder which does not create any notifications. I’ll get to it when I get to it. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Important email, like direct notes from family members, enter a “Primary” folder which creates notifications. </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That’s it. All email is divided into “Updates” and “Primary” - a river of cruft to be viewed whenever I can, and high priority emails to be read and dealt with.</p>\n<p>This is consistent with Hey’s perspective on email, as described by David Heinemeier Hansson on a recent <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+JptgYvXNs\">Basecamp podcast</a>: treat most email as a “river to be dipped into”, rather than fretting about the “Inbox Zero” goal of acting upon every email that arrives. This philosophy has been distilled into Hey application itself, which very much follows the Ruby on Rails approach of <a href=\"https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/\">convention over configuration</a> - it’s opinionated on how email should be handled. </p>\n<h2 id=\"the-hey-client\">The Hey client</h2>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cavan.us/media/posts/10/hey5.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://cavan.us/media/posts/10/responsive/hey5-xs.jpg 300w ,https://cavan.us/media/posts/10/responsive/hey5-sm.jpg 480w ,https://cavan.us/media/posts/10/responsive/hey5-md.jpg 768w\"  alt=\"Hey screenshot\" width=\"753\" height=\"641\" /></figure></p>\n<p>The iOS client is neatly designed and has well-written copy. The introductory emails are sensibly put together. Much of Hey’s secret sauce is requiring use of optional structures from other email services. To compare to the obvious competitor - Gmail: </p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Hey</th>\n<th>Gmail</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Imbox</td>\n<td>Inbox/Priority Inbox</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The Feed</td>\n<td>“Promotions” category</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Paper Trail</td>\n<td>“Updates” category</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Set Aside</td>\n<td>Archive</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reply Later</td>\n<td>Reminders</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2 id=\"recommendation\">Recommendation</h2>\n<p>If you struggle to create and maintain an email workflow, so would appreciate a guiding hand, Hey is worth trying. I do not so the $99/year asking price is too hard to justify. </p>\n<p>The Venn diagram of “has enough email to overwhelm,” “lacks strong workflow today” and “would pay &gt;$99/year to fix” is much larger for work than personal email, which makes Basecamp’s decision to initially focus on personal email (no custom domain support) a little strange. I understand there is a business version (referred to as “Hey Us” internally) in the works. </p>\n",

It brings over 800 breweries and 4,000 beers to the US’s largest celebration of craft beer. <!--more--></p>\n<p>Sadly trying all 4,000 was not on the cards, but over two three hour sessions my trusty glass conveyed 99 samples for my tasting pleasure. </p>\n<h3 id=\"day-one-thursday\">Day One (Thursday)</h3>\n<p>My two favorites of the night were two imperial stouts from the Chicago area - <a href=\"https://www.moodytongue.com/\">Moody Tongue</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/35410/311870/\">Gingerbread</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flossmoorstation.com/\">Flossmoor Station</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/612/167508/\">Shadow of the Moon</a>. Perhaps I have a ‘type’ after all.</p>\n<p>Strangest of the night goes to Reality Checker (sour series) from Florida’s <a href=\"http://crookedthumbbrew.com/\">Crooked Thumb</a>, which was described as a Berliner Weisse but tasted precisely like an orange creamsicle.</p>\n<h3 id=\"day-two-saturday-afternoon\">Day Two (Saturday Afternoon)</h3>\n<p>Top beer of the day goes to the <a href=\"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/30824/318218/\">Mexican Stout</a> by <a href=\"https://shipbottombrewery.com/\">Ship Bottom Brewery</a> out of Beach Haven NJ. A gorgeous stout brewed with coffee, chocolates, ancho chipotle peppers, cinnamon, lactose and vanilla beans.</p>\n<p>Runner up goes to <a href=\"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/10607/427858/\">Master Blend: Orange Cream</a> from Brooklyn’s <a href=\"https://sixpoint.com\">Sixpoint Brewery</a>. The orange peel adds to the imperial stout base without overwhelming it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"local-washington-flavor\">Local Washington Flavor</h3>\n<p>Two beers from Washington’s Whatcom and Skagit counties went home with awards - a gold medal for <a href=\"https://wanderbrewing.com/\">Wander</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/34416/122493/\">Correspondent Foreign Extra Stout</a>, plus a bronze for <a href=\"http://chuckanutbreweryandkitchen.com/\">Chuckanut</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/18879/258109/\">Fest Bier</a> (believe it’s brewed at their Burlington location). </p>\n<h3 id=\"tips-for-your-next-visit\">Tips For Your Next Visit</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>As you can see in the header image of this post, GABF is a packed conventional hall. Thousands of attendees crowd every lane between the beer stalls. Beating the crowds entirely is largely impossible, but if you’d like a slightly quieter experience I recommend aiming for the second half of each session. Unfortunately, you will also experience more drunks, but I only encountered one bad drunk in my six hours.</li>\n<li>Volunteers at each stall are instructed to pour 1oz tasters; in reality they typically pour 1.5-2oz. That may seem like a tiny amount but it is more than enough to get a sense of the beer. In fact, if you are aiming to experience many beers in a single session, I would strongly recommend not finishing a taster unless you’re particularly enjoying it. Save that acreage in your liver for something better. </li>\n<li>If you like to document each beer you could use an app like <a href=\"https://untappd.com/home\">Untappd</a>, but they can be rather slow as you try to jump from beer to beer. I’d recommend either scribbling notes on paper, or using the voice memo function on your phone to record a few thoughts. </li>\n<li>There are eight bathrooms around the convention hall but they will always have queues. If you’re comfortable using a Porta Pottie, there are ~90 available in a loading dock on the Champa St side of the hall - no queue needed. </li>\n<li>Take a reusable bottle to fill with water. You’ll need to hydrate but GABF only provides 5oz disposable cups with their water coolers. Queuing for a few minutes to get 5oz of water isn’t good enough. </li>\n<li>There are photo booths dotted around the arena but don’t rely on them for top quality pictures. They featured the selfie camera of four year old Microsoft tablets, which are substantially worse than a selfie from almost any cellphone these days. Example below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cavan.us/media/posts/5/GABFheadshot.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://cavan.us/media/posts/5/responsive/GABFheadshot-xs.jpg 300w ,https://cavan.us/media/posts/5/responsive/GABFheadshot-sm.jpg 480w ,https://cavan.us/media/posts/5/responsive/GABFheadshot-md.jpg 768w\"  alt=\"GABF headshot\" width=\"1194\" height=\"857\" /></figure></p>\n",
