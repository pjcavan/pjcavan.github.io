            "content_html": "<p>By a half-hour into the Swansea game on February 24 we were 2-0 down. Let's take a closer look.</p>\n\n<h2>First Goal: Ronald at 18 minutes.</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>1. Initial Cross</strong>. We have three players on the crosser at different distances (bottom left of image - O’Nien, Seelt and Trai - so two of our ostensible CBs). Swansea have three receivers crashing into the box with two defenders on them. Dan Neil is technically involved (edge of the penalty arc) but barely moves a muscle until the goal. For all practical purposes it’s 3 on 2 if we can’t stop the cross, which we can’t.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cavan.us/media/posts/92/1-5.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1433\"></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>2. Header</strong>. Cross bounces to middle of the three receivers who heads at Patto. All of O’Nien, Seelt, Trai and Neil can see the 3 on 2 situation but no one gets above a slow jog toward the action. You could argue they believe themselves too far away to impact the game; Hjelde, certainly not too far away, is a statue from here on.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cavan.us/media/posts/92/2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2559\" height=\"1437\"></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>3. Save</strong>. Patto palms away the header. The two closest attackers plus Styles are alive to the danger. Hjelde sees it but doesn’t move an inch; everyone else (who's closer than Ekwah) is walking.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cavan.us/media/posts/92/3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1434\"></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Follow Up</strong>. Styles giving his all to stop it. Hjelde still in concrete. Patto had fallen almost upside down stopping the header and can only ineffectually flick out a foot from a prone position. 1-0 to Swansea.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cavan.us/media/posts/92/4.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1438\"></figure>\n<h2>Second Goal: Ronald at 28 minutes.</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>1. Our Intercept. </strong>Seelt cuts out a Swansea lob and lays it off to O’Nien. Their attackers, initially following the lob and then pressing, are all moving up at speed. We seem switched off - watching events while stationary or walking. The eventual scorer, Ronald, is at the top of the screen with Styles a couple yards away. Note that for later.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cavan.us/media/posts/92/1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1430\"></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>2. Under Pressure. </strong>O’Nien has attackers bearing down and feels he has to offload. Styles, Hjelde and Seelt are partially or fully blocked by pressers (and not making themselves more available) and he probably feels he doesn’t have time to turn toward Patto. Remaining options are to hoof it, keep the ball, or pass to Neil.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cavan.us/media/posts/92/3-3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1430\"></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>3. Fateful Pass.</strong> Swansea’s Paterson, who O’Nien can definitely see, is excellently positioned to intercept a pass to Neil. Allen, running forward from behind Neil, barges past and indeed intercepts. I can forgive the latter if I assume O’Nien couldn’t see Allen through Neil; the former seems poor decision making (in a rush and under pressure). </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cavan.us/media/posts/92/2-3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1436\"></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>4. Start of Attack.</strong> At the moment of interception there’s danger but not unthinkably so - we have three defenders closer to the goal than Ronald and Neil is almost level. Unhelpfully, Styles has barely moved since phase one and so lost any hope of sticking with Ronald.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cavan.us/media/posts/92/4-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2557\" height=\"1437\"></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>5. Dribble. </strong>Allen powers forward, surveying the situation as he goes. O’Nien is backpedalling between Allen and the goal, sensibly enough. Ronald is calling for it with both barrels. Hjelde is moving to a reasonable zone for a second defender but lacks the presence of mind to notice the massive danger behind him. Styles nowhere useful. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cavan.us/media/posts/92/5.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1434\"></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>6. Cross. </strong>Allen crosses to Ronald. As it leaves Allen’s boot, the nearest red &amp; white shirt to Ronald is about ten yards distant. Styles still hopelessly behind and Hjelde hasn’t realized what’s lurking.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cavan.us/media/posts/92/6.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2556\" height=\"1431\"></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>7. Shot.</strong> Ronald initially hits it into the turf and I think Patto expects more of a bounce. His initial body movement infers a higher shot then he can’t get his right leg fully out in time. 2-0 to Swansea.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://cavan.us/media/posts/92/7.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1433\"></figure>",

The closest was <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/import/onenote\">Obsidian's first-party OneNote importer</a> - it pulled in the first OneNote workbook I pointed it at, then steadfastly refused any further ones. If you go that route, I recommend having Obsidian pull all of your OneNote content at once, even if that complicates later organization.</p>\n<p>What did work: find an old (v6.5) binary of Evernote<sup id=\"fnref:1\"> <a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a> </sup>. You won't find them on Evernote's site anymore but a brief search will bring up links. Install it and use Evernote's dedicated OneNote importer, then export that to Evernote's export format (ENEX). Have Bear import that ENEX and you're mostly done. </p>\n<p>It's the least bad method I found by a large margin but there are quirks to be aware of.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bear uses a tag- rather than folder-based structure and will not respect the folder structure automatically. My work-around was to import one workbook at a time and apply folder-imitating tags (use the 'untagged' smart tag after each import). </li>\n<li>The rich-text-to-Markdown conversion is... a mixed bag. All text content should be there; conversion of bulleted lists and tables is iffy. </li>\n<li>Each note will have the creation date and time added (within the body) at the top, and \"Created with OneNote\" at the bottom. </li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" class=\"footnote\">\n<p>Try <a href=\"https://cdn1.evernote.com/mac-smd/public/Evernote_RELEASE_6.5_453172.zip\">this for Mac</a> and <a href=\"https://filehippo.com/download_evernote/6.5.4.4720.0/\">this for Windows</a>.

How many turned up (explanation of debate)<br><br>I’d categorize the justifications to Sean Spicer &amp; Donald Trump’s comments into three buckets:<br><br>1. “Lying is bad, but they didn’t lie.”<br><br>There are already a substantial number of 9/11-Truther-style “there were actually over a million people at Trump’s inauguration but the MSM is lying to us!” theories. I won’t further elucidate how they might be mistaken.<br><br>2. “Lying is bad, but a lying Trump is better than a crooked Hillary.”<br><br>This realpolitik notion understands that Spicer &amp; Trump told bald-faced lies in recent days, and accepts that lying is a bad thing, but rationalizes their flaws as acceptable when compared to a greater evil (in their mind, Democrats in power).<br><br>3. “Trump lied, and that’s a good thing.”<br><br>This position is the hardest to parse, but a longer version is ‘we’ve had generations of scheming, elitist politicians who hate Real America . Donald might lie, but that just shows that he’s a real person who’ll always do what’s right for Real Americans.”<br><br>(why does this matter? they’ll lie about other things, and their supporters won’t care.)</p>",

It's a five star hotel, the spa is expensive, fair enough. </p>\n<p>We were less impressed that we were suite-less. Our \"<em>Suite Seattle Staycation</em>\", to \"<em>enjoy an upgrade to a suite</em>\", got us into what seemed their smallest and most basic room. On mentioning this to the front desk - \"<em>oh, yeah, that's not guaranteed. If we don't have a suite you don't get one</em>.\" Do you then get a refund for the upgrade? Ha, not a chance. </p>",
