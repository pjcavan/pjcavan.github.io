That is possible, but can be a pain. </p>\n<p>A brief search will offer all sorts of options: perhaps export as HTML, or Word docs (?), or copy manually (the horror), or <a href=\"https://github.com/epatters/onenote-export\">online services</a> that pull from the Office API, or the Obsidian importer (then export back out to Bear), or a wide universe of Python scripts that scrape OneNote into a Pandoc conversion. </p>\n<p>None of those worked well for me. The closest was <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/import/onenote\">Obsidian's first-party OneNote importer</a> - it pulled in the first OneNote workbook I pointed it at, then steadfastly refused any further ones. If you go that route, I recommend having Obsidian pull all of your OneNote content at once, even if that complicates later organization.</p>\n<p>What did work: find an old (v6.5) binary of Evernote<sup id=\"fnref:1\"> <a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a> </sup>. You won't find them on Evernote's site anymore but a brief search will bring up links. Install it and use Evernote's dedicated OneNote importer, then export that to Evernote's export format (ENEX). Have Bear import that ENEX and you're mostly done. </p>\n<p>It's the least bad method I found by a large margin but there are quirks to be aware of.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bear uses a tag- rather than folder-based structure and will not respect the folder structure automatically. My work-around was to import one workbook at a time and apply folder-imitating tags (use the 'untagged' smart tag after each import). </li>\n<li>The rich-text-to-Markdown conversion is... a mixed bag. All text content should be there; conversion of bulleted lists and tables is iffy. </li>\n<li>Each note will have the creation date and time added (within the body) at the top, and \"Created with OneNote\" at the bottom. </li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" class=\"footnote\">\n<p>Try <a href=\"https://cdn1.evernote.com/mac-smd/public/Evernote_RELEASE_6.5_453172.zip\">this for Mac</a> and <a href=\"https://filehippo.com/download_evernote/6.5.4.4720.0/\">this for Windows</a>.

In ye olden days when <a href=\"https://evernote.com\">Evernote</a> was a dominant player (and, to be fair, made a decent format in ENEX) the pathway was straightforward - get your notes to ENEX (perhaps with a temporary Evernote account), then your new service would likely import it. Various services have scaled back their import options, including Evernote (you can get around with an old .exe).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.notion.so\">Notion</a> was perhaps the hardest to evaluate. It has a good web version, Windows and Mac apps (no Linux), few (relevant) caps on the free accounts, powerful templates, etc. You could run all sorts of businesses largely on Notion. But, it felt too heavy/busy for my needs.</li>\n<li>If you're willing to stick to plain text or Markdown there are all sorts of options, from <a href=\"https://keep.google.com\">Google Keep</a> to <a href=\"https://obsidian.md\">Obsidian</a>/<a href=\"https://joplinapp.org\">Joplin</a>/<a href=\"https://bear.app\">Bear</a>/<a href=\"https://standardnotes.com\">Standard</a>/etc. That didn't fit my needs.</li>\n<li>The final four were OneNote, Evernote, Notion, Apple Notes. Notion addressed above. Apple Notes, being Apple + data, had quirks, such as importing everything with a December 2010 date. Evernote was a strong contender but feels in flux (in process of being acquired). OneNote is currently one of the ugliest options (refresh expected in Q2) and isn't great with export, but ticks the rest of my boxes for $0.</li>\n</ol>",

By volume, about twice as much as the rice. Bring the soup to a boil and let it simmer while the rice fries. To deep fry the rice, it goes in a wire mesh strainer and is lowered into the deep fryer. You keep stirring the rice until it becomes tan colored and acquires a nutty aroma. Then it needs to drain completely for about 5 minutes, then it's very carefully introduced to the soup.
